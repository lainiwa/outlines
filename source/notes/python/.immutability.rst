Immutability
############

Immutable structures
====================
* `Python etc 666 <https://t.me/pythonetc/666>`_
* `How to Make an Immutable Dict in Python <https://adamj.eu/tech/2022/01/05/how-to-make-immutable-dict-in-python/>`_
* `SO: What does frozen mean for dataclasses? <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66194804/what-does-frozen-mean-for-dataclasses>`_

Immutable versions of standard types:

* Immutable ``list`` is ``tuple``.
* Immutable ``set`` is ``frozenset``.
* Immutable ``bytearray`` is ``bytes``.
* ``dict`` doesn't have an immutable version
  but it has ``types.MappingProxyType`` wrapper that makes it immutable

.. code-block:: py

  from types import MappingProxyType

  orig = {1: 2}
  immut = MappingProxyType(orig)

  immut[3] = 4
  # TypeError: 'mappingproxy' object does not support item assignment

  orig[3] = 4
  immut[3]
  # 4

For dataclasses we can set ``frozen=True, slots=True``.
Refer to `Dataclasses section <#dataclasses>`_ for details and gotchas.

Final type
==========
* `docs: Final type <https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Final>`_
* `PEP 591 â€“ Adding a final qualifier to typing <https://peps.python.org/pep-0591/>`_
* `SO: final annotation and decorator in python3.8 <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57596086/final-annotation-and-decorator-in-python3-8>`_

.. code-block:: py

  MAX_SIZE: Final = 9000
  MAX_SIZE += 1  # Error reported by type checker
