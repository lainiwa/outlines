In bash/zsh keyword ``function`` intruduced for historical reasons. Use more portable ``f() ...``

Local variables are dinamically scoped (seen by functions down the call stack):

.. code-block:: sh

    f1() { local a; a=1 f3; }
    f2() { local a; a=2 f3; }
    f3() { echo $a; }

    f1  # prints 1
    f2  # prints 2
