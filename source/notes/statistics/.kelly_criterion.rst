   Betting everything maximizes your mean wealth.
   Using the Kelly Criterion maximizes your median wealth.
   ...
   Incidentally, the choice of maximizing the median is somewhat arbitrary.
   You can also use a similar approach to maximize, say, the 25th percentile outcome,
   at the expense of average and median outcomes.
